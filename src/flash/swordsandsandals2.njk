    <h2>⚠️ WARNING ⚠️ </h3> 
    <p>
        This game is completely broken. Buying anything from any shop <b>WILL</b> corrupt your save, making the game essesntially unplayable. (or at least very difficult to progress.) I think its because the servers are down. I'll remove this game soon, except in the unlikely case i find a fix.
